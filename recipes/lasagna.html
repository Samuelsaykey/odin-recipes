        <h5>How to layer lasagna</h5>  
            <ol>
                <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
                <li>Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce</li>
                <li>Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.</li>
    <h4>how to bake</h4> 
        <p>Bake this lasagna recipe for a total of one hour. To get a perfect browned cheese topping, you’ll need to bake it in two stages.</p>  
        <ol>
            <li>Layer and cover it tightly with aluminum foil to retain the moisture.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, and heated through, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and the lasagna is bubbling.</li>

        </ol> 
        <h4>Important: Let the Lasagna Rest</h4>
        <p>Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut. Resting is not required when reheating.</p>
